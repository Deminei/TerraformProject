Introduction to Ansible:
- Ansible is an open-source automation tool that allows you to automate the configuration, deployment, and management of systems.
- It uses a simple and declarative language to describe tasks and configurations, making it easy to learn and use.
- Ansible operates over SSH, so there is no need to install any agent software on the managed hosts.

Installation:
- Ansible can be installed on a control node, which is the machine from which you manage other hosts.
- It can be installed on various operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- The installation process typically involves installing Python, as Ansible is written in Python, and then using Python's package manager, pip, to install Ansible.

Basic Concepts:
- Inventory: Ansible uses an inventory file to define the hosts or groups of hosts it will manage. It can be a simple text file or a dynamic script that generates the inventory dynamically.
- Modules: Ansible tasks are performed using modules, which are standalone scripts that Ansible executes on remote hosts. Modules can be written in any programming language, but most are written in Python.
- Playbooks: Playbooks are Ansible's configuration, deployment, and orchestration language. They are written in YAML format and describe a set of tasks to be executed on remote hosts.
- Tasks: Tasks are the individual units of work in Ansible. They define the actions to be taken on the managed hosts.
- Roles: Roles are a way to organize and reuse playbooks and tasks. They provide a structured and modular approach to managing configurations.

Inventory Management:
- The inventory file is used to define the hosts and groups that Ansible will manage.
- Hosts can be specified by their IP addresses or domain names.
- Groups allow you to organize hosts based on certain criteria, such as their role or location.
- Inventory files can be static, where hosts and groups are defined manually, or dynamic, where the inventory is generated dynamically using external scripts or cloud providers' APIs.

Playbook Structure:
- Playbooks are written in YAML format and consist of a set of plays.
- A play is a collection of tasks that are applied to a specific set of hosts.
- Each play specifies the hosts or groups it targets, the tasks to be executed, and various optional parameters.
- Tasks within a play are executed sequentially unless explicitly parallelized.
- Playbooks can also define variables, handlers (actions triggered by events), and other advanced features for more complex automation scenarios.
